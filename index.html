              leave the band to embark on solo careers.</li>
            <li><strong class="year">1975</strong> - He becomes a global superstar after the release of the
              album Natty Dread, which included the landmark hit
              "No Woman, No Cry". However, Marley still performed in a free concert
              organized by the Prime Minister of Jamaica.</li>
            <li><strong class="year">1976</strong> - An assassination in Jamiaca injured Marley and his wife
              Rita. </li>
            <li><strong class="year">1977</strong> - Relocated to England. During this time Marley broke one of
              his toes while playing futbol in Paris. Doctors find cancerous cells
